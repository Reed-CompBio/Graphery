We prepared some frequently asked questions for you. 

### What is Graphery?

Graphery is a platform with interactive tutorials about graph algorithms alongside real-world biological networks. It is designed with biological researchers in mind, where users can click through Python code and see _how_ the algorithms work on networks from different biological domains.

### How do I use it?

If you want a tour of the platform take the first tutorial: [Getting Started](link).  This is the best place to start!  The other tutorials are available on the [Tutorials] tab.  If you want to see the networks that are offered, click the [Graphs tab](link).  If you click a graph, you are taken to a playground view where you can interact with the graph, run the code associated with tutorials.

### How to run my own code on Graphery?

You can execute existing code in the cloud by clicking [insert cloud button] on the editor.  If you click [insert unlock button] , you will change the [user settings](link) so you can modify existing code or write your own code.  Click [insert cloud button] whenever you want the code to run.

If you would like to run your code locally on your machine (instead of in the cloud), [instructions are available here](https://docs.graphery.reedcompbio.org/user-manual/local-server/).

### I found a bug, how to report it?

Please file a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FlickerSoul/Graphery/issues) - thanks in advance!

### Can I make contributions to Graphery?

Yes! If you have an idea for a **graph** or a **tutorial**, then file a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/FlickerSoul/Graphery/issues).  If you would like to add content to the website, we are always looking for contributors to add **graphs**, **tutorials**, and **translations**. [Email us to learn more](email link).
