This folder is intended to specify the API backend server exposes to the public. It currently has two sections, `graphql` and `ws`. In the [`graphql`](./graphql/) folder, three files, [`types.md`](./graphql/types.md), [`queries.md`](./graphql/queries.md), and [`mutations.md`](./graphql/mutations.md) details the a set of API following the [GrahQL](https://graphql.org) specs. In the [`ws`](./ws/) folder, the only file denotes a set of API relying on pure websocket.
